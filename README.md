## Introduction

This is a tensorflow re-implementation of **OPD-Net: Prow Detection Based on Feature Enhancement and Improved Regression Model in Optical Remote Sensing Imagery**.

This project is modified based on [R2CNN_Faster-RCNN_Tensorflow](https://github.com/DetectionTeamUCAS/R2CNN_Faster-RCNN_Tensorflow), special thanks to the authors for sharing.

The complete code will be organized and made public later.


## Requirements
1. tensorflow >= 1.2
2. cuda8/9.0
3. python3.6 (anaconda3 recommend)
4. opencv(cv2)
5. tfplot


## Compile
cd $PATH_ROOT/libs/box_utils/
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
cd $PATH_ROOT/libs/box_utils/cython_utils
python setup.py build_ext --inplace

## Preparation
1. pretrained weights
please download resnet50_v1„ÄÅresnet101_v1 pre-trained models on Imagenet, put it to data/pretrained_weights.
2. trained_model

## Inference
1. first modify the INFERENCE_IMAGE_PATH and INFERENCE_SAVE_PATH in the $PATH_ROOT/libs/configs/cfgs.py

2. in $PATH_ROOT/tools:
```python inference.py --gpu=0```

## TODO:
- [ ] data prepare
- [ ] Training
