## Abstract

This is a tensorflow re-implementation of **OPD-Net: Prow Detection Based on Feature Enhancement and Improved Regression Model in Optical Remote Sensing Imagery**.

This project is modified based on [R2CNN_Faster-RCNN_Tensorflow](https://github.com/DetectionTeamUCAS/R2CNN_Faster-RCNN_Tensorflow), special thanks to the authors for sharing.

The complete code will be organized and made public later.
